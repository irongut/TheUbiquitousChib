Category = Vendors
Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - Watson
Language = n/a
Version = 1.2.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a melee weapon vendor to Watson who sells everything Coach Fred is missing, with custom faction, displayed weapons, usable laptop & radio and two lore shards.
Description = 
Are you a Watson resident, unable to buy a knife for your kitchen because of an NCPD lockdown?
Do you prefer the elegance of a Tanto over a silenced pistol?
Are you bored of Coach Fred's tired selection of clubs and his attempts to make you a boxer?
Do you long for a Katana, Punk Knife or even... a Hammer?

Then come on down to the Northside Motel on Martin Street where our sales person has the melee weapon of your dreams! New stock is delivered all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Updates:
	v1.2 adds a custom faction for the vendor with two lore shards - one at the shop and the other somewhere in Watson for you to find.
	v1.1 adds common mods to the vendor, decorations, a usable laptop, radio and a street light to make the area look more like a pop-up shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a few familiar faces!

Customers visit for 1 hour from: [spoiler]02:00, 07:00, 11:00, 16:00, 22:00[/spoiler]

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Common, Uncommon and Rare mods.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods.
Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

This mod adds 22 meshes, 3 devices, 2 entities, up to 3 NPCs and the vendor. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.

I've tested to ensure the changes do not interfere with the gig Flight of the Cheetah so it is safe to install before helping Hwangbo.
