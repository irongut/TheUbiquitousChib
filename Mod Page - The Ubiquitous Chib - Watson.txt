Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - Watson
Language = n/a
Version = 1.0.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a melee weapon vendor to Watson who sells everything Coach Fred is missing, including mods.
Description = 
Are you a Watson resident, unable to buy a new knife for your kitchen because of an NCPD lockdown?
Do you prefer the elegance of a Tanto over a silenced pistol?
Are you bored of Coach Fred's tired old selection of clubs and his attempts to make you into a boxer?
Do you long for a Katana, Punk Knife or even... a Hammer?

Then come on down to the Northside Motel on Martin Street where our sales person has the melee weapon of your dreams!
New stock is delivered all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)
