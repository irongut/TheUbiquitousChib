Category = Gameplay / Vendors
Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - Westbrook
Language = n/a
Version = 1.2.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a melee weapons and mods vendor to the corner of Grant & Lele in Westbrook with custom faction, displayed weapons, laptop, radio and two lore shards.
Description = 
Are you worried about the homeless camps encroaching on North Oak?
Do the paparazzi break into your mansion but your manager won't let you carry a gun?
Would the gift of a ceremonial Kukri or Tanto seal that important business deal?
But you're intimidated by the booster gangs hanging around Spector Cheng's gym?

Then come on down to the observation platform on the corner of Grant & Lele where our expert staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our local contacts deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Update:
	v1.2 adds a custom faction for the vendor with two lore shards - one at the shop and the other somewhere in Westbrook for you to find.
	v1.1 adds military cases, displayed weapons, a laptop, a radio and a spotlight to make the area look more like a pop-up shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face!

Customers visit for 1 hour from: [spoiler]02:00, 10:00, 16:00, 22:00[/spoiler]

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Rare and Epic Blade, Melee, Thrown and Blunt mods.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 18 meshes, 3 devices, 2 entitites and an occasional NPC as well as the vendor. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
