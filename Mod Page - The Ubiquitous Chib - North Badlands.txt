Description = 
Is life in Night City too fast and noisy for you?
Do you prefer a quiet trailer in Red Peaks or Rocky Ridge Plains?
Have you found an abandoned container but don't have a Crowbar?
Or your Javelina got a flat but you lost your Tire Iron in a Haboob?

Then come on down to DaKota Garage off I-9 where our staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our Nomad drivers deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)
