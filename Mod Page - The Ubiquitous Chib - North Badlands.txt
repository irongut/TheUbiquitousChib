Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - North Badlands
Language = n/a
Version = 1.1.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a vendor to DaKota Garage in North Badlands who sells all melee weapons and mods with military cases, displayed weapons, a laptop and a radio.
Description = 
Is life in Night City too fast and noisy for you?
Do you prefer a quiet trailer in Red Peaks or Rocky Ridge Plains?
Have you found an abandoned container but don't have a Crowbar?
Or your Javelina got a flat but you lost your Tire Iron in a Haboob?

Then come on down to DaKota Garage off I-9 where our staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our Nomad drivers deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Update: v1.1 adds military cases, displayed weapons, a laptop, a radio and a lights to make the area look more like a Nomad weapon shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face!

Customers visit for 1 hour from: [spoiler]00:00, 08:00, 17:00, 21:00[/spoiler]

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Rare and Epic Blade, Melee, Thrown and Blunt mods.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 35 meshes, 6 devices and up to 2 NPCs as well as the vendor. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
