Description = 
Is life in Night City too fast and noisy for you?
Do you prefer a quiet trailer in Red Peaks or Rocky Ridge Plains?
Have you found an abandoned container but don't have a Crowbar?
Or did your Javelina get a flat but you lost your Tire Iron in a Haboob?

Then come on down to DaKota Garage off I-9 where our expert staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our Nomad drivers deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Even if you're not in the market for a new weapon, help yourself to our free coffee and get Energized for the road ahead! (+25% max stamina, +30% stamina regeneration)

Updates:
	v2.0 adds a coffee machine and a custom faction for the vendor with two lore shards - one at the shop and the other elsewhere in the Badlands for you to find. New requirements are necessary, see below.
	v1.1 adds military cases, displayed weapons, a laptop, a radio and a lights to make the area look more like a Nomad weapon shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face!

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Rare and Epic Blade, Melee, Thrown and Blunt mods.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 38 meshes, 7 devices, 2 entities, up to 2 NPCs and the vendor as well as removing 5 trash items. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
