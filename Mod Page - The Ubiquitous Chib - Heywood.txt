Overview = Adds a vendor to the alley behind The Time Machine in Heywood who sells all melee weapons and relevant mods with displayed weapons, a laptop and a radio.
Description = 
Are you a Heywood salaryman shuffling between the office and your conapt in Wellsprings every day?
Does your boss disrespect you because you don't have a ceremonial sword or Tanto?
Are you a major league mercenary late for a meeting at Embers but you forgot your Neurotoxin knife?
Do you desire the fear and respect on the street that comes with a CHAINSWORD?

Then come on down to The Ubiquitous Chib - Heywood, behind The Time Machine where our expert staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our local contacts deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Update: v1.1 adds military cases, displayed weapons, a laptop, a radio and a street light to make the area look more like a weapon shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face or two!

Customers visit for 1 hour from: [spoiler]03:00, 07:00, 13:00, 19:00, 23:00[/spoiler]

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Rare and Epic Blade, Melee, Thrown and Blunt mods.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 30 meshes, 3 devices, up to 2 NPCs and the vendor as well as removing 14 trash items. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
