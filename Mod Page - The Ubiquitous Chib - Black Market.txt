Mod Page: The Ubiquitous Chib - Black Market

Category = Vendors
Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - Black Market
Language = n/a
Version = 2.0.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a vendor to Lincoln Dock in City Center who sells all iconic melee weapons, iconic mods and recalled, expired or otherwise illegal consumables. Free tea and coffee (with Energized buff) are provided for all customers. Also adds lights, decoration and NPCs to this unused area.
Description = 
Are you a collector of rare weapons of exquisite beauty and deadly grace?
Or a Legend of The Afterlife looking for the perfect steel to complement your style?
Do you crave the taste of Comrade Kolya's Premium Black Caviar with Devildick Pepper Chips?
Or long to open a can of AssKick on your enemies with a Gold-Plated Baseball bat?

Then come on down to Lincoln Dock on Republic Way where our expert staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Enjoy our complimentary tea or coffee while you browse. Our international contacts deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

This side of Lincoln Dock was unused and needed lights and some work to bring it to life. The mod adds street lights, a laptop, a radio, tea and coffee interactions, weapon displays, customers, security guards and dock workers. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may recognise a face or two!

Famous customers visit for 2 hours from: [spoiler]01:00, 06:00, 15:00, 20:00[/spoiler]

v2.0 is a major rework of the shop area replacing existing decoration with weapon displays, adding tea and coffee facilities, generic NPC customers between the famous ones, security guards, a custom faction for the vendor and two lore shards - one at the shop and the other elsewhere in the City Center for you to find. New requirements are necessary, see below.

Also Available:
The Ubiquitous Chib - Watson
The Ubiquitous Chib - Dogtown
The Ubiquitous Chib - North Badlands
The Ubiquitous Chib - Heywood
The Ubiquitous Chib - Westbrook
The Ubiquitous Chib - Santo Domingo

Performance & Compatibility

This mod adds meshes, devices, NPCs, two interactions and a vendor as well as removing existing meshes in an unused area. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.

Phantom Liberty

If you don't have Phantom Liberty then items from the expansion will not appear in the shop, including some weapons, consumables and the iconic mods, but the vendor will still work. I can't test without the expansion so please let me know if you run into problems.

World edits and NPCs were added using the amazing World Builder by keanuWheeze / NexusGuy999. Many thanks also to deceptious, psiberx and the authors of all the required mods without whom this would not be possible.
