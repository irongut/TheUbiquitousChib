Description = 
Are you down on your luck or on the run?
Have you fallen off Skid Row and ended up in Dogtown?
Did you pawn your Katana for Black Lace?
And your favourite Tomahawk got stuck in a Scav skull this morning?

Then come on down to the Sky Gym in Longshore Stacks where our staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our stealth drones deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Update: v1.1 adds military cases, displayed weapons, a usable laptop, a radio and a light to make the area look more like a pop-up shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face!

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons, Rare and Epic mods and performance enhancements. Designed for use from the start of Phantom Liberty to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons, Legendary (Tier 5) mods and performance enhancements. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 15 meshes, 3 devices, an occasional NPC and the vendor as well as removing 5 items. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
