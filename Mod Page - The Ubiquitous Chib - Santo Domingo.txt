Category = Vendors
Name = The Ubiquitous Chib - Santo Domingo
Language = n/a
Version = 1.2.0
Author = Irongut
Overview = Adds a vendor to Kendal Park in Santo Domingo who sells all melee weapons, relevant mods and some consumables with custom faction, weapon display, usable laptop & radio and two lore shards.
Description = 
Are you barred from the Tripple Xtreme Epic Workout Center due to a disagreement with the owner?
Does the thought of a pit fight against the meat mountain known as Rhino fill you with dread?
Has your water filter broken for the third time this week and you need a Crowbar to fix it?
Or do you want to show off at the next 6th Street rally with a shiny new Tomahawk?

Then come on down to Kendal Park where our friendly staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams! Our local contacts deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)

Update:
	v1.2 adds a custom faction for the vendor with two lore shards - one at the shop and the other somewhere in Santo Domingo for you to find.
	v1.1 adds decorations, a usable laptop and a radio to make the area look more like a pop-up shop. Keep an eye open for other customers, you may see a familiar face!

Customers visit for 1 hour from: [spoiler]00:00, 07:00, 18:00, 21:00[/spoiler]

Files

Upcoming Merc
Level appropriate melee weapons like a vanilla vendor with Epic and Legendary mods plus some consumables.
Designed for use from the start of the game to respect gameplay balance.

Legend of NC
Legendary (Tier 5) melee weapons and mods plus some consumables. Designed for use at level 50+ or if you don't care about gameplay balance.

INSTALL ONE.
Both versions overwrite each other so you can swap between them as you progress through the game if you want to.

Performance & Compatibility

The mod adds 30 meshes, 2 devices, 2 entities, an occasional NPC and the vendor as well as removing 10 trash items. Since these are native edits the performance impact is minimal and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't change the same area.
