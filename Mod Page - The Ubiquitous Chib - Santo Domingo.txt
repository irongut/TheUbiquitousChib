Description = 
Are you barred from the Tripple Xtreme Epic Workout Center due to a disagreement with the owner?
Does the thought of a pit fight against the meat mountain known as Rhino fill you with dread?
Has your water filter broken for the third time this week and you need a Crowbar to fix it?
Or do you want to show off at the next 6th Street rally with a shiny new Tomahawk?

Then come on down to Kendal Park where our friendly staff will help you find the melee weapon of your dreams!
Our local contacts deliver new stock all the time so check back regularly! (1 hour refresh)
